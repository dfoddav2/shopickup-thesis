  abstract = {The growing demands of logistics and supply chain management have created an urgent need for scalable, high-performance, and secure geospatial platforms capable of handling real-time data exchange. RESTful APIs have become one of the fundamental architectural solutions, as their implementation enables interoperability, modular application design, and cross-platform integration within logistics ecosystems. This research paper presents the data structure and implementation of a geospatial logistics platform based on RESTful API architecture, developed using TypeScript and Laravel. The proposed system leverages the strong typing and asynchronous processing capabilities of TypeScript, which enhance maintainability and error handling, while Laravel provides a robust backend framework for orchestrating APIs, managing authorization, and manipulating data. A relational architectural design was adopted to ensure scalability, and geospatial functionality was integrated through mapping libraries and spatial databases. The platform was evaluated using performance benchmarks, analyses of API response times, and developer surveys. The results demonstrate a significant reduction in response latency, increased request throughput, and lower error rates compared with traditional PHP-based REST frameworks. Moreover, the use of TypeScript scripts streamlined the development process, making the codebase less cumbersome and easier to maintain. The findings highlight the potential of combining modern typed programming languages with established backend frameworks to address the challenges of geospatial logistics platforms, particularly in improving the accuracy of real-time geospatial data, optimizing routes, and enhancing system scalability. This study contributes to the growing body of literature on logistics software architectures and provides practical guidance for future implementations of geospatial APIs.},

  abstract = {Service-oriented architectures (SOA) is an emerging approach that addresses the requirements of loosely coupled, standards-based, and protocol- independent distributed computing. Typically business operations running in an SOA comprise a number of invocations of these different components, often in an event-driven or asynchronous fashion that reflects the underlying business process needs. To build an SOA a highly distributable communications and integration backbone is required. This functionality is provided by the Enterprise Service Bus (ESB) that is an integration platform that utilizes Web services standards to support a wide variety of communications patterns over multiple transport protocols and deliver value-added capabilities for SOA applications. This paper reviews technologies and approaches that unify the principles and concepts of SOA with those of event-based programing. The paper also focuses on the ESB and describes a range of functions that are designed to offer a manageable, standards-based SOA backbone that extends middleware functionality throughout by connecting heterogeneous components and systems and offers integration services. Finally, the paper proposes an approach to extend the conventional SOA to cater for essential ESB requirements that include capabilities such as service orchestration, “intelligent” routing, provisioning, integrity and security of message as well as service management. The layers in this extended SOA, in short xSOA, are used to classify research issues and current research activities.},

  abstract = {Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA) has emerged as an architectural approach that enhances the service delivery performance of existing traditional systems while still retaining their most important features. This approach, due to its flexibility of adoption, has gained the attention of both academic and business entities, especially in the development of world-leading technologies such as Cloud Computing (CC) and the Internet of Things (IoT). Although many studies have listed the success factors of SOA, a few minor failures have also been reported in the literature. Despite the availability of rich material on SOA, there is a lack of systematic reviews covering the different aspects of the SOA concept in Information Systems (IS) research. Therefore, the central objective of this study is to review existing issues of SOA and share the findings with the academia. Hence, a systematic literature review (SLR) was conducted to analyse existing studies related to SOA and the factors that led to SOA success and failure from 2009 to 2019. To completely cover all SOA-related research in the IS field, a two-stage review protocol that included automatic and manual searching was applied, resulting in 103 primary studies. The articles were categorised into four research themes, namely: SOA Adoption, SOA Concepts, SOA Impact, and SOA Practice. The result shows that the academic research interest on SOA increased recently with most of the articles covering SOA Practice followed by SOA Adoption. Moreover, the findings of this review highlighted SOA Governance, SOA Strategy, Financial Issues and Costs, and Education and Training as the most significant factors of SOA adoption and implementation. Consequently, the outcomes will assist professionals and experts in organisations as well as academic researchers to focus more on these factors for successfully adopting and implementing SOA.},

  abstract = {Businesses are increasingly deploying their services on the web, in the form of web applications, SOAP services, message-based services, and, more recently, REST services. Although the movement towards REST is widely recognized, there is not much concrete information regarding the technical features being used in the field, such as typical data formats, how HTTP verbs are being used, or typical URI structures, just to name a few. In this paper, we go through the Alexa.com top 4000 most popular sites to identify precisely 500 websites claiming to provide a REST web service API. We analyze these 500 APIs for key technical features, degree of compliance with REST architectural principles (e.g., resource addressability), and for adherence to best practices (e.g., API versioning). We observed several trends (e.g., widespread JSON support, software-generated documentation), but, at the same time, high diversity in services, including differences in adherence to best practices, with only 0.8 percent of services strictly complying with all REST principles. Our results can help practitioners evolve guidelines and standards for designing higher quality services and also understand deficiencies in currently deployed services. Researchers may also benefit from the identification of key research areas, contributing to the deployment of more reliable services.},

  abstract = {In modern software architecture, the API gateway has become a foundational component for enabling scalable, secure, and resilient distributed systems. This paper presents a systematic review of API gateway patterns, synthesizing insights from academic literature and industry documentation to develop a comprehensive understanding of their evolution, design, and application. Beginning with the historical transition from monolithic APIs to gateway-centric microservices, the study contextualizes the rise of gateways within the broader movements toward cloud-native development, DevOps, and serverless computing. The paper introduces a pattern classification schema encompassing roles such as Aggregator, Proxy, Adapter, and Facade, while also distinguishing between scalability-oriented and security-centric design strategies. Patterns like Backend-for-Frontend, Edge Caching, Token Exchange, and Policy Enforcement are examined in depth to evaluate their impact on throughput, service isolation, identity management, and regulatory compliance. Challenges related to deployment, observability, and fault tolerance are also explored, alongside best practices and tooling insights from leading gateway platforms. The findings underscore the strategic importance of API gateways in modern software design, offering actionable guidance for architects and developers. The study concludes with recommendations for future research on hybrid gateway-mesh models, AI-driven traffic management, and gateway integration in edge and Internet-of-Things environments. This review aims to bridge the gap between theoretical constructs and practical implementations, contributing a structured foundation for the next generation of scalable and secure application architectures.},

After many years of project work, and many misunderstandings and failed meetings and workshops, it can only be stated that the word has multiple and misunderstood meanings.

The methodology to obtain the results consists of three cases where the response time, number of requests, and costs per million are analyzed by a certain technology for a microservice and monolithic architecture. Results obtained such as response time, the number of requests supported, and costs per million requests allow to select the proper architecture. When dealing with large and highly complex systems the microservices architecture can be advantageous since it simplifies the codebase, even the time demand in implementing the microservices system offsets the drawbacks associated with the monolithic architecture.},

  abstract = {With the rapid development of Internet technology today, B2B e-commerce quickly grows up. Enterprises only have their own business system, is unable to meet the rapidly changing business needs, which bring by corporate merger acquisition and fierce competition. Enterprises must be able to face to the market quickly, find a better approach of information systems integration, so that suppliers and partners are more effective collaboration through the network. SOA including the protocols and standards are a new distributed scheme. The goal of SOA is to provide a common technology layer, which is independent upon languages and platforms. The applications of different platforms need this technology layer to connect and integrate with each other. SOA technology is used in e-commerce can be good to meet these needs. In the network era, B2B e-commerce is developing continuously. Although most of the corporations have accomplished the informational- action, they always are independently. How to integrate the systems of several corporations and use the B2B e-commerce systems synthetically becomes the most important problem. With the change from developing a new system to using existing systems adequately, the service-oriented architecture becomes the best way to satisfy the new demand. SOA can increase reusability, reduce the total cost, Therefore, SOA has become an effective method to solve application integration. This paper provides first an overview of the B2B e-commerce, then a brief introduction of the key SOA technologies, and final a scheme of using SOA technologies to construct a B2B e-commerce model on the J2EE platform.},

  abstract = {With the rapid development of information technology and computer networks, internnet-based e-commerce has also emerged, and has achieved tremendous development in recent years. Most enterprise systems are developed based on heterogeneous platforms and different information standards. The interaction and integration between enterprises is very difficult, and the traditional distributed architecture can not solve the current needs. Service-oriented architecture is a new generation of distributed software architecture that solves the above problems. As a new generation of distributed software architecture, it not only improves the reusability of software, but also achieves good scalability. This paper uses the SOA architecture to design the e-commerce platform, and designs the interface service to realize the service composition of the e-commerce platform.},

BI enables business users to report on, analyze and optimize business operations to reduce costs and increase revenues. Organizations use BI for strategic and tactical decision making where the decision-making cycle may span a time period of several weeks (e.g., campaign management) or months (e.g., improving customer satisfaction).Competitive pressures coming from a very dynamic business environment are forcing companies to react faster to changing business conditions and customer requirements. As a result, there is now a need to use BI to help drive and optimize business operations on a daily basis, and, in some cases, even for intraday decision making. This type of BI is usually called operational business intelligence and real-time business intelligence.},

  abstract = {In this era of big data, firms struggle with processing, analyzing and making sense of the "big data" in real-time, hence the ability to extract valuable information in time for decision-making. The lambda architecture has become a potent framework that allows extensive data systems to handle large and real-time data sets, both batch and streaming. Through Lambda Architecture, this paper discusses Lambda architecture and its relation to up-to-date data analysis. We will review the core architecture parts, including batch, speed, and serving layers, and then show how they work to provide a practical solution to colossal data processing and service. Moreover, we dive into the usage of Lambda Architecture by employing comprehensive big data technologies, including Apache Kafka for taking data in, Apache Hadoop for batch processing, Apache Spark for stream processing, and Apache Cassandra for serving the results. Moreover, we discuss the positive aspects and the issues that may arise with applying Lambda Architecture and even provide some real examples related to this area. The performance of the scheme we implemented shows that the Lambda Architecture models a sustainable and functional system to exploit big data for quick analytics and decision-making in all areas of life. INTRODUCTION In the modern era, the amount of data produced and garnered by organizations is beyond our wildest imaginations. Processing and analyzing this information in real time is crucial for business market share and managerial decisions. On the contrary, even though traditional data processing architectures are designed to handle high volumes and varieties of data, they may not perform well enough and prevent timely and effective analytics. The Lambda Architecture proposed by Dubuc [1] confronts this challenge by providing a joint manner to process massive data sets in both batch and real-time. The Lambda Architecture integrates batch processing and live processing technology to increase the reliability of real-time extensive data analytics operations. It consists of three main layers: the manufacturing stage, the acquiring stage and the delivery stage. The batch layer is involved in processing the entire dataset at a time; thus, it can visualize the dataset comprehensively. The actual time layer, in contrast, deals with incoming data retrieval directly to process instantly to take immediate response and analysis. The serving tier of Hadoop combines outputs from the batch and speed layers, presenting a consolidated image of the data for both downstream applications and users. This article will go into detail on how the architecture of Lambda can provide real-time big data analytics by aiding the process. We will cover the architecture's fundamental attributes and how it is implemented using the widely used big data technologies. We will also discuss the advantages and disadvantages of architecture. On top of that, we will give some examples of real-world use cases for Lambda Architecture and industry applications to show how practical Lambda Architecture is in different areas of work.},

  abstract = {In the field of logistics many companies strive to optimize their processes with different automated systems when the importance of measuring operations highlights. However companies often have problems in defining the right measures and how to visualize them efficiently for various user groups. By identifying key performance indicators companies are able to monitor and analyze the most valuable processes. This is why this study aims to find out what are the possible key performance indicators in the case company and how to visualize them efficiently to various user groups. The purpose of this study is to create ideologically and visually adaptable models for sharing and monitoring the measures and increase understanding of key performance indicators and visualization.  In the beginning of this study theories for performance measurement and visualization are introduced. These theories are utilized in the creation of operating model and dashboard plan for the case company. In addition, based on the executed interviews, this study addresses the case company’s measures that affects the performance measurement. At the end, the created operating model and dashboard plan, that can be adapted in the operations of the case company, are introduced.  Based on the results of this study, there can be concluded that used measures are eligible for different processes. However, many of those measures should be improved by visualization. By adapting the created operating model and the dashboard plan, the case company is able to share appropriate measures to the right user groups. With these models the case company is also able to utilize the principles and benefits of effective visualization. Finally future recommendations on how to utilize various issues, that have an effect on to the models, are introduced.},

  abstract = {Performance appraisal is the process of assessing employee performance on a regular basis. To support the concept of performance management system, employee’s personal objectives should be aligned with the organisation's strategic goals. The effectiveness of a company's key business objectives will be evaluated by the Key Performance Indicator (KPI). The KPI will be used at all levels of an organisation to assess whether the company's goal is achieved. Each organisation and department will use different KPIs to measure the organisational success based on specific business goals and targets. One way to assess the relevance of performance indicator is based on the SMART concept (Specific, Measurable, Attainable, Relevant, and Time-bound). Therefore, this paper aims to discuss a framework for KPI to determine the extent of a structure or purpose in accordance with SMART standards for evaluating employee performance. The implementation of the system provides a platform to create, manage and analyse the KPI data, get an upto-date performance result using dashboard displays and provides a simplified process for employees to key in the goals and evaluations on a timely basis.},
