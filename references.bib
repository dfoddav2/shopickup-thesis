  abstract = {The growing demands of logistics and supply chain management have created an urgent need for scalable, high-performance, and secure geospatial platforms capable of handling real-time data exchange. RESTful APIs have become one of the fundamental architectural solutions, as their implementation enables interoperability, modular application design, and cross-platform integration within logistics ecosystems. This research paper presents the data structure and implementation of a geospatial logistics platform based on RESTful API architecture, developed using TypeScript and Laravel. The proposed system leverages the strong typing and asynchronous processing capabilities of TypeScript, which enhance maintainability and error handling, while Laravel provides a robust backend framework for orchestrating APIs, managing authorization, and manipulating data. A relational architectural design was adopted to ensure scalability, and geospatial functionality was integrated through mapping libraries and spatial databases. The platform was evaluated using performance benchmarks, analyses of API response times, and developer surveys. The results demonstrate a significant reduction in response latency, increased request throughput, and lower error rates compared with traditional PHP-based REST frameworks. Moreover, the use of TypeScript scripts streamlined the development process, making the codebase less cumbersome and easier to maintain. The findings highlight the potential of combining modern typed programming languages with established backend frameworks to address the challenges of geospatial logistics platforms, particularly in improving the accuracy of real-time geospatial data, optimizing routes, and enhancing system scalability. This study contributes to the growing body of literature on logistics software architectures and provides practical guidance for future implementations of geospatial APIs.},
