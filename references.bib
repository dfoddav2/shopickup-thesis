  abstract = {The growing demands of logistics and supply chain management have created an urgent need for scalable, high-performance, and secure geospatial platforms capable of handling real-time data exchange. RESTful APIs have become one of the fundamental architectural solutions, as their implementation enables interoperability, modular application design, and cross-platform integration within logistics ecosystems. This research paper presents the data structure and implementation of a geospatial logistics platform based on RESTful API architecture, developed using TypeScript and Laravel. The proposed system leverages the strong typing and asynchronous processing capabilities of TypeScript, which enhance maintainability and error handling, while Laravel provides a robust backend framework for orchestrating APIs, managing authorization, and manipulating data. A relational architectural design was adopted to ensure scalability, and geospatial functionality was integrated through mapping libraries and spatial databases. The platform was evaluated using performance benchmarks, analyses of API response times, and developer surveys. The results demonstrate a significant reduction in response latency, increased request throughput, and lower error rates compared with traditional PHP-based REST frameworks. Moreover, the use of TypeScript scripts streamlined the development process, making the codebase less cumbersome and easier to maintain. The findings highlight the potential of combining modern typed programming languages with established backend frameworks to address the challenges of geospatial logistics platforms, particularly in improving the accuracy of real-time geospatial data, optimizing routes, and enhancing system scalability. This study contributes to the growing body of literature on logistics software architectures and provides practical guidance for future implementations of geospatial APIs.},

  abstract = {Service-oriented architectures (SOA) is an emerging approach that addresses the requirements of loosely coupled, standards-based, and protocol- independent distributed computing. Typically business operations running in an SOA comprise a number of invocations of these different components, often in an event-driven or asynchronous fashion that reflects the underlying business process needs. To build an SOA a highly distributable communications and integration backbone is required. This functionality is provided by the Enterprise Service Bus (ESB) that is an integration platform that utilizes Web services standards to support a wide variety of communications patterns over multiple transport protocols and deliver value-added capabilities for SOA applications. This paper reviews technologies and approaches that unify the principles and concepts of SOA with those of event-based programing. The paper also focuses on the ESB and describes a range of functions that are designed to offer a manageable, standards-based SOA backbone that extends middleware functionality throughout by connecting heterogeneous components and systems and offers integration services. Finally, the paper proposes an approach to extend the conventional SOA to cater for essential ESB requirements that include capabilities such as service orchestration, “intelligent” routing, provisioning, integrity and security of message as well as service management. The layers in this extended SOA, in short xSOA, are used to classify research issues and current research activities.},

  abstract = {Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA) has emerged as an architectural approach that enhances the service delivery performance of existing traditional systems while still retaining their most important features. This approach, due to its flexibility of adoption, has gained the attention of both academic and business entities, especially in the development of world-leading technologies such as Cloud Computing (CC) and the Internet of Things (IoT). Although many studies have listed the success factors of SOA, a few minor failures have also been reported in the literature. Despite the availability of rich material on SOA, there is a lack of systematic reviews covering the different aspects of the SOA concept in Information Systems (IS) research. Therefore, the central objective of this study is to review existing issues of SOA and share the findings with the academia. Hence, a systematic literature review (SLR) was conducted to analyse existing studies related to SOA and the factors that led to SOA success and failure from 2009 to 2019. To completely cover all SOA-related research in the IS field, a two-stage review protocol that included automatic and manual searching was applied, resulting in 103 primary studies. The articles were categorised into four research themes, namely: SOA Adoption, SOA Concepts, SOA Impact, and SOA Practice. The result shows that the academic research interest on SOA increased recently with most of the articles covering SOA Practice followed by SOA Adoption. Moreover, the findings of this review highlighted SOA Governance, SOA Strategy, Financial Issues and Costs, and Education and Training as the most significant factors of SOA adoption and implementation. Consequently, the outcomes will assist professionals and experts in organisations as well as academic researchers to focus more on these factors for successfully adopting and implementing SOA.},

  abstract = {Businesses are increasingly deploying their services on the web, in the form of web applications, SOAP services, message-based services, and, more recently, REST services. Although the movement towards REST is widely recognized, there is not much concrete information regarding the technical features being used in the field, such as typical data formats, how HTTP verbs are being used, or typical URI structures, just to name a few. In this paper, we go through the Alexa.com top 4000 most popular sites to identify precisely 500 websites claiming to provide a REST web service API. We analyze these 500 APIs for key technical features, degree of compliance with REST architectural principles (e.g., resource addressability), and for adherence to best practices (e.g., API versioning). We observed several trends (e.g., widespread JSON support, software-generated documentation), but, at the same time, high diversity in services, including differences in adherence to best practices, with only 0.8 percent of services strictly complying with all REST principles. Our results can help practitioners evolve guidelines and standards for designing higher quality services and also understand deficiencies in currently deployed services. Researchers may also benefit from the identification of key research areas, contributing to the deployment of more reliable services.},

  abstract = {In modern software architecture, the API gateway has become a foundational component for enabling scalable, secure, and resilient distributed systems. This paper presents a systematic review of API gateway patterns, synthesizing insights from academic literature and industry documentation to develop a comprehensive understanding of their evolution, design, and application. Beginning with the historical transition from monolithic APIs to gateway-centric microservices, the study contextualizes the rise of gateways within the broader movements toward cloud-native development, DevOps, and serverless computing. The paper introduces a pattern classification schema encompassing roles such as Aggregator, Proxy, Adapter, and Facade, while also distinguishing between scalability-oriented and security-centric design strategies. Patterns like Backend-for-Frontend, Edge Caching, Token Exchange, and Policy Enforcement are examined in depth to evaluate their impact on throughput, service isolation, identity management, and regulatory compliance. Challenges related to deployment, observability, and fault tolerance are also explored, alongside best practices and tooling insights from leading gateway platforms. The findings underscore the strategic importance of API gateways in modern software design, offering actionable guidance for architects and developers. The study concludes with recommendations for future research on hybrid gateway-mesh models, AI-driven traffic management, and gateway integration in edge and Internet-of-Things environments. This review aims to bridge the gap between theoretical constructs and practical implementations, contributing a structured foundation for the next generation of scalable and secure application architectures.},

After many years of project work, and many misunderstandings and failed meetings and workshops, it can only be stated that the word has multiple and misunderstood meanings.

The methodology to obtain the results consists of three cases where the response time, number of requests, and costs per million are analyzed by a certain technology for a microservice and monolithic architecture. Results obtained such as response time, the number of requests supported, and costs per million requests allow to select the proper architecture. When dealing with large and highly complex systems the microservices architecture can be advantageous since it simplifies the codebase, even the time demand in implementing the microservices system offsets the drawbacks associated with the monolithic architecture.},

  abstract = {With the rapid development of Internet technology today, B2B e-commerce quickly grows up. Enterprises only have their own business system, is unable to meet the rapidly changing business needs, which bring by corporate merger acquisition and fierce competition. Enterprises must be able to face to the market quickly, find a better approach of information systems integration, so that suppliers and partners are more effective collaboration through the network. SOA including the protocols and standards are a new distributed scheme. The goal of SOA is to provide a common technology layer, which is independent upon languages and platforms. The applications of different platforms need this technology layer to connect and integrate with each other. SOA technology is used in e-commerce can be good to meet these needs. In the network era, B2B e-commerce is developing continuously. Although most of the corporations have accomplished the informational- action, they always are independently. How to integrate the systems of several corporations and use the B2B e-commerce systems synthetically becomes the most important problem. With the change from developing a new system to using existing systems adequately, the service-oriented architecture becomes the best way to satisfy the new demand. SOA can increase reusability, reduce the total cost, Therefore, SOA has become an effective method to solve application integration. This paper provides first an overview of the B2B e-commerce, then a brief introduction of the key SOA technologies, and final a scheme of using SOA technologies to construct a B2B e-commerce model on the J2EE platform.},

  abstract = {With the rapid development of information technology and computer networks, internnet-based e-commerce has also emerged, and has achieved tremendous development in recent years. Most enterprise systems are developed based on heterogeneous platforms and different information standards. The interaction and integration between enterprises is very difficult, and the traditional distributed architecture can not solve the current needs. Service-oriented architecture is a new generation of distributed software architecture that solves the above problems. As a new generation of distributed software architecture, it not only improves the reusability of software, but also achieves good scalability. This paper uses the SOA architecture to design the e-commerce platform, and designs the interface service to realize the service composition of the e-commerce platform.},
