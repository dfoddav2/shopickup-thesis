# shopickup-thesis

Accompanying repository of the Shopickup project specifically for writing an IMC Krems BSc thesis in the topic. The thesis' main focus is the optimal integration of multiple shipping provider APIs into a singular system.

The application code can be found on the [following repository](https://github.com/dfoddav2/shopickup), however it is not publicly available at this time, due to the project's product nature. To gain access to the code, please contact me directly.

## Recommended Setup

Firstly, make sure you have a LaTeX distribution installed on your system. For Windows, MiKTeX is a popular choice, while Mac users often go for MacTeX. Linux users can install TeX Live via their package manager. I will be using TeX Live for this project as it is cross-platform.

```brew
brew install --cask texlive
```

In addition, you will need to install Zotero and the Better BibTeX plugin for reference management.

```brew
brew install --cask zotero
brew install --cask zotero-better-bibtex
```

I also recommend you install the extensions outlined in the [extensions.json](.vscode/extensions.json) file if you are using VSC as your editor.
